Week2P3.py is the MDP solver for Week2 Problem3 (2DOF state, 1D environment).
In this implementation, we have Xmax and Vmax for our states definition. 
For more detailed constrains, please visit the coauthor post for Week2-P3.

Week2P3withVisual.py  is the MDP solver with a visual on the result

OptimalValueAndPolicy is the image of the result table 

Week2P3(with wabble).py is the MDP solver for Week2 Problem3 (2DOF state, 1D environment).
In this implementation, we have Xmax and Vmax for our states definition as well as a random noise on our velocity.
There's a chance of Pw (0<=Pw<=0.5) that our velocity will randomly go up by 1 or go down by 1.
