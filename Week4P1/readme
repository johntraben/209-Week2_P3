Week4P1_DFS_NO_obstacle.py:
    This is just the implementation DFS approach itself without any refinement.
    Takes input of initial postion and desired position on chessboard and return a path that connectes the two.

Example:
Enter Starting Postion on chessboard (pair of integer from 0 to 7 ,seperated by space): 3 7
Enter Final Postion on chessboard (pair of integer from 0 to 7 ,seperated by space): 0 0
Following is a path:
(3, 7)
(2, 5)
(1, 3)
(0, 1)
(2, 0)
(1, 2)
(0, 0)
